# 1. Match Black's line length (88) so they stop fighting
max-line-length = 88

# 2. Ignore specific errors that clash with Black
# E203: Whitespace before ':' (Black does this intentionally)
# E501: Line too long (We handle this with max-line-length above, but this double-checks)
# W503: Line break before binary operator (Old rule, Black does the opposite)
extend-ignore = E203, E501, W503

# 3. Exclude things we don't own
